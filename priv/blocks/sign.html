      <li> 
        Below, please paste the private key that you copied earlier. This
        signs the bet. It locks the amount you wage into the blockchain
        until the bet is resolved.

        If you win the bet, you will receive another key, the Event Key.
      </li>
      <li> 
        You will use the private key you copied earlier, and the Event key
        to transfer the won amount into your wallet.

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>
    <ll>
      <li>
        The Event Key makes you the owner of the contract transaction.  
      </li>
      <li> 
        You could leave the Bitcoins there, but should transfer them into
        your wallet. 
      </li>
      <li> 
        That is more convenient, more visible and safer.
      </li>
      <li> 
        We do not hold the money at any time, it is locked in the blockchain.
      </li>
