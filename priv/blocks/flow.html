    <ll>
      <li> Send the amount to a new address we created for you. </li>

      <li> If you won, you will get an unlock key from the oracle (in this case, us) </li>

  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>
    <ll>
      <li> 
        The Bitcoins are locked in, for the duration of the bet.
      </li>
      <li> 
        ... they are in no-one's wallet for that time.
      </li>
      <li> 
        ... but they ARE in the blockchain.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Technically you OWN the full amount as soon as you receive the key
        that the winner of the bet receives from the oracle.
      </li>
      <li> 
        The final transaction is only to make the Bitcoins easier to spend.
      </li>
      <li> 
        There is no way to unlock the money without at least one bidders
        private keys.
      </li>
      <li> 
        Bidders can unlock the the money without the oracle at any time when
        one gives his private key to the other (which was created for this one
        bet only, so it can be shared without risk.)
      </li>
      <li> 
        We cannot unlock the bet and access the Bitcoins, unless we happen to
        be both the oracle and the other party holding the other side of the
        bet.
      </li>
      <li> 
        ... which in the first prototype we ARE.
      </li>
      <li> 
        ... while the aim is for the future to be NEITHER.
      </li>
      <li> 
        ... which will then make the contracts completely decentralized.
      </li>
