  <h4>Notes</h4>
  <p>
    <ll>
      <li>
        The Event Key makes you the owner of the contract transaction.  
      </li>
      <li> 
        You could leave the Bitcoins there, but should transfer them into
        your wallet. That is more convenient, more visible and safer.
      </li>
      <li> 
        We do not hold the money at any time, it is locked in the blockchain.
      </li>
